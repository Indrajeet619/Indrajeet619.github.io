The issue we are hoping to solve" description - 
Worldwide Fishing industry is 85 billion US dollars. Fishing companies after they catch fish, their quality needs to be checked. Fish suffer from many diseases like bacterial infection or fungus which can cause many poeple ill. Also small fish caught are given to fish feed for aquafarming which can cause many large fish to get diseases. 



How our technology solution can help - 
AI model along with conveyor belt machine to detect fish diseases and fish



"Our idea" long description of your team's solution - 
Fish diseases can be identified from their color. We have developed small conveyor belt sorting machine which uses IBM watson AI. This machine can be put on fishing vessel, here fish are placed on conveyor belt, esp32 microcontroller camera takes photos and IBM watson AI model checks color of fish for any diseases. Also it checks damage to fish. Machine can also be setup at wholealers or distributors as they deal with very large quantities of fish and are close to consumers. A website account stores companyâ€™s fishing records. 
We have used IBM Watson AI  studio, node js server esp32 microcontroller and esp camera and then connected them on  conveyor belt machine from our local college.  



#Technology implementation -
Listing of all IBM AI services - 
AI model is trained using tensor flow, Ibm watson studio and IBM cloud engine to host node js website and IBM Nosql cloudant database.
Listing of any other IBM technology - None
